# sunflowercopy
Sunflower copy is an android app that I use to investigate features of Android programming that I learn.

It is based on the sunflower demo provided by google, initially as a way to test some of my skills.

I am currently working on implementing some tests using skills learnt in the Advanced Android in Kotlin codelabs.
