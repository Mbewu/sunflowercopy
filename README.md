# sunflowercopy
Sunflower copy is an android app that I use to investigate features of Android programming that I learn.

It is based on the sunflower demo provided by google, initially as a way to test some of my skills.

I am currently working on implementing some tests using skills learnt in the Advanced Android in Kotlin codelabs.

Updates:
2020/09/11
-> renamed PlantInformation2 to Plant
-> added more defaults to Plant (only id and name needed now)
-> removed unused files
-> replaced all Log calls with Timber
-> changed so that using Room's coroutine functionality suspend functions
-> changed so that database is only read from file once using a worker
